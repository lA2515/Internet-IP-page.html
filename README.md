    <h1><b>Internet Protocols and IP Address</b></h1>
    
    <p>
        <b>Internet Protocols (IP)</b> are sets of rules that govern how data is transmitted and received over the internet. Their primary <b>function</b> is to establish communication standards between devices, ensuring reliable data delivery. Some common examples of internet protocols include:
        <b>HTTP</b> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), 
        <b>HTTPS</b> (HTTP Secure), 
        <b>FTP</b> (File Transfer Protocol), 
        <b>TCP/IP</b> (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), and 
        <b>SMTP</b> (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).
    </p>
    
    <h2><b>Types and Versions of IP Addresses</b></h2>
    
    <p>
        An <b>IP address</b> is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to a network. IP addresses are used to identify and locate devices, enabling communication across networks. There are two main versions of IP addresses:
        <b>IPv4</b> (Internet Protocol version 4) and 
        <b>IPv6</b> (Internet Protocol version 6). 
        <b>IPv4</b> uses 32-bit addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) and is the most widely used version, but has limited address space. 
        <b>IPv6</b> uses 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334) to accommodate the growing number of internet-connected devices. While <b>IPv4</b> is still dominant, <b>IPv6</b> is increasingly being adopted for its larger address space and improved features.
